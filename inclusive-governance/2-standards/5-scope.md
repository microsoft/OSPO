# Scope

Microsoft's Code of Conduct, and any related Etiquette Guidelines apply to all open source collaborators: employees, contractors, contributors, and community members - although the process may be different depending on each.  In Open Source, the lines dividing these groups is often fluid - as often community members  are hired into projects, and staff often stay as part of the community when they move between roles or companies.

Also included in the scope of this document those externally influencing our projects and communities. Basically this means, that we won't ignore harm done ot our communities if caused by an external person or group.
